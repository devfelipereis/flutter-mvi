## 2.0.0

**ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES - Complete Architecture Rewrite**

This is a major rewrite of the MVI package with significant breaking changes.

### New Architecture

* **Replaced signals with ValueListenable**: Now uses Flutter's built-in ValueListenable and ValueNotifier for reactive state management
* **Dual ViewModel approach**: 
  - `SimpleViewModel` for basic state management without effects
  - `ViewModel` for full MVI pattern with effects support
* **New mixins**: 
  - `SimpleViewModelMixin` for connecting widgets to SimpleViewModels
  - `ViewModelMixin` for connecting widgets to ViewModels with effects
* **Method rename**: `provideViewModel()` renamed to `createViewModel()` for better clarity

### Migration Guide

This version is not backward compatible. To migrate:

1. Replace `BaseViewModel` with either `SimpleViewModel` or `ViewModel`
2. Update your mixins to use `SimpleViewModelMixin` or `ViewModelMixin`
3. Rename `provideViewModel()` to `createViewModel()`
4. Replace signals-based state observation with ValueListenableBuilder
